## General Information
This is to put into practice what I have learned theoretically about the Python language so far by following various online courses.


## Technologies Used
- Python 3.12.2
- IDE (Visual Studio Code e/o PyCharm)


## Features
List of ready works:
- KAN-46:           Solving exercises on functions, loop, list, set and dictionary
- KAN-49-Library:   Implement a Python program that demonstrates polymorphism through different types of library
                    items (books and journals) and uses basic exception handling to manage checkout processes.
- KAN-49-Zoo:       Implement a simple Python program that models animals in a zoo using multiple inheritance 
                    to share behaviors and characteristics across different animal classes.
- KAN-49-Vehicle:   Implement a Python program that models a simplified vehicle management system,
                    showcasing inheritance and polymorphism, without using property decorators for encapsulation.


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_.
